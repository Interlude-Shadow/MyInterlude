   <p>My greatest assets include my determination and desire for success. I always go above and above to finish tasks on schedule and according to deadlines. I've taken on more work, worked extra shifts, and brought my work home because I'm determined for initiatives to be successful. Enthusiasm is one of my biggest assets. I think those that are passionate about what they do are considerably more productive. I have discovered that when I approach all chores and undertakings with passion, I am able to surpass goals. I work well with others as a team. I like being a part of teams, and I think working together makes me lot more productive. I worked with a group of three people to build a score tracking system in my programming 2. We completed the project on schedule and with no errors thanks to the smooth operation of our team. As a result of this assignment, our teacher praised us for our excellent collaboration. </p>


   <center><p><strong>A Summary of “Twelve Pillars” by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener</strong></p></center>
   <p><strong>Chapter 4</strong><br>
       Charlie lives his life not really had a specific goal in mind or end goal to his career and it took him his friend to tell him that he need to learn to set goals. For me the main reason for setting a goal is to see what it requires of you to achieve it setting goals entails deciding where you want to go and then devising a strategy to get there. Setting goals that stretch you and force you to do things differently will lead you to the future you desire. Don't wait for others to set your goals for you.<br><br>

      <strong>Chapter 5</strong><br>       
      Every day is an opportunity, but only one best opportunity. Your best opportunities are those that align with your overall goals and should be what you spend your time on Mr Davis would say that every day is being spent wisely if it's being spent in the best way possible. I believe every day presents numerous opportunities but your best opportunities are those that align with your overall goals and should be where you spend your time. Don't just get through the day and not spend your time on what is important rather than what is urgent. We must be the architects of our own lives.<br><br>


      <strong>Chapter 6</strong><br>
       Surround yourself with winners as Charlie said in this chapter take some time and think to yourself who am I associating with, what impact do they have on me? What are they trying to get me to say? Where are they taking me? What are they making me think? successful people seek relationships with other successful people who will push, challenge, and encourage them to grow. <br><br>

      <strong>Chapter 7</strong>
       As Mr Davis says: ‘Formal education will make you a living. Self-education will make you a fortune.’ Self-education is what you teach yourself. It is what you learn along the way that allows you to keep improving and growing. Most people do not continue to learn and grow; in order to stand out, focus on continuous learning.
